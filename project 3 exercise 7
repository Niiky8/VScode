/*
In this formula, the term  is called the discriminant.If, then the equation has a single(repeated) root.If, the equation has two real roots
.If, the equation has two complex roots.Write a program that prompts the user to input the value of a(the coefficient of), b(the coefficient of x), and c(the constant term)
and outputs the type of roots of the equation.Furthermore, if, the program should output the roots of the quadratic equation. (Hint : Use the function pow from 
the header file cmath to calculate the square root.Chapter 3 explains how the function pow is used.)



start 
    output prompt for a
    input a 
    if input from cin fails 
        output failure message 
    output prompt for b
    if input from cin fails
        output failure message 
    output prompt for c
    if input from cin fails
        output failure message
    equation1 = (b*b) - (4 * a * c)
    if equation1 is less then 0 
        output There are two complex root 
    if equation1 is more or equal to 0 
        equation2 = ( - b + sqrt(equation1)) / (2 * a)
        equation3 = ( - b - sqrt(equation1)) / (2 * a)
        output equation2
        output equation3
