 /*write a program that can be used to calculate the federal tax. The tax is calculated as follows:
For single people, the standard exemption is $4,000; for married people, the standard exemption
is $7,000. A person can also put up to 6% of his or her gross income in a pension plan.
The tax rates are as follows: If the taxable income is:

Between $0 and $15,000, the tax rate is 15%.

Between $15,001 and $40,000, the tax is $2,250 plus 25% of the taxable income over $15,000.

Over $40,000, the tax is $8,460 plus 35% of the taxable income over $40,000.

Prompt the user to enter the following information:

Marital status

If the marital status is “married,” ask for the number of children under the age of 14

Gross salary (If the marital status is “married” and both spouses have income, enter the combined salary.)

Percentage of gross income contributed to a pension fund

Your program must consist of at least the following functions:

Function getData: This function asks the user to enter the relevant data.

Function taxAmount: This function computes and returns the tax owed.

To calculate the taxable income, subtract the sum of the standard exemption, 
the amount contributed to a pension plan, and the personal exemption, which is $1,500 per person.
(Note that if a married couple has two children under the age of 14, then the personal exemption is.)
Declare  string marriageStat
 double grossSal , pensionFund, taxableInc
 Int numOfChild , standardExem, tax

getData()
taxAmount()
    Output Tax owed

 getData()
    Accept marriageStat, grossSal, pensionFund, numOfChild, standardExem as parameters
    Output prompt for marriage status
    Input marriageStat
    If marriageStat is "married":
        Output prompt for children
        Input numOfChild
        standardExem = 7000
    Else:
        numOfChild = 1
       standardExem = 4000
    Output prompt for  gross salary
    Input grossSal
    Do
        Output prompt for percentage of gross income is contributed to a pension fund
        Input pensionFund
        If pensionFund is greater than 6 or less than 0:
            Output incorrect input.
    Until pensionFund is between 0 and 6
    pensionFund = pensionFund / 100

taxAmount()
    personalExem = 1500 * numOfChild
    taxableInc = grossSal - (standardExem + personalExem)
    taxableInc = taxableInc - grossSal * by pensionFund
    If taxableInc is less than or equal to 20000:
        tax = taxableInc * by 0.15
    Else if taxableInc is less than or equal to 50000:
        tax = (20000 * 0.15) + ((taxableInc - 20000) *  0.25)
    Else:
        tax = (20000 *  0.15) + (30000 *  0.25) + ((taxableInc - 50000) *  0.35)
    If tax is less than 0:
        tax = 0
    Return tax
